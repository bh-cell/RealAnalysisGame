Title "An Introduction to (Formal) Real Analysis"

Introduction "
# Welcome to Real Analysis, The Game!

This course is currently being developed for Rutgers University Math 311H by [Alex Kontorovich](https://math.rutgers.edu/~alexk).
 Please email alex.kontorovich@rutgers.edu for suggestions/corrections,
or better yet, post a PR/issue to
https://github.com/AlexKontorovich/RealAnalysisGame.

For the main course website, go to: https://alexkontorovich.github.io/2025F311H.

This course takes you through an Introduction to the Real Numbers, rigorous `ε`-`δ` Calculus,
and basic Point-Set Topology.
To get started, click on
**\"Level 1: The Story of Real Analysis\"**, and good luck!

*An Introduction to Formal Real Analysis - Interactive Edition*

## About this Course

This course follows the historical crises that forced mathematicians to rebuild
mathematics from the ground up in the 19th century. You'll learn why concepts
like `ε`-`δ` definitions became necessary and how to use them to do advanced calculus.
