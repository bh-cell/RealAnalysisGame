"\n"
"After conquering the constant sequence, let's up our game: if a sequence converges, then doubling that sequence also converges, and converges to double the original limit.\n"
"\n"
"## The Factory Scaling Challenge\n"
"\n"
"Imagine our Machinist receives a challenge from the Engineer: 'Please double all the lengths, but maintain the same quality standards.' How should the Machinist respond?\n"
"\n"
"If the Engineer demands the doubled lengths be within $\\varepsilon$ of $2L$, the Machinist can't just demand that the original process meet the original tolerance $\\varepsilon$, because\n"
"\n"
"`|2 * a (n) - 2 * L| < 2 * ε`,\n"
"\n"
"not `ε`. Instead, we must be more clever. Can you think of what to do?\n"
"\n"
"That's right, the `ε` in the original process\n"
"is *arbitrary*, so we can play with it!\n"
"If we could get the original process can guarantee output within $\\varepsilon/2$ of $L$, then doubling that output will be within $\\varepsilon$ of $2L$.\n"
"\n"
"This is the key insight: **when scaling by a constant, we need to scale our tolerance demands inversely**.\n"
"\n"
"## The Mathematical Setup\n"
"\n"
"Suppose we have:\n"
"- A sequence $a : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that converges to $L$\n"
"- A sequence $b : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ with the property that $b(n) = 2 \\cdot a(n)$ for all $n$\n"
"\n"
"We want to prove that $b$ converges to $2 \\cdot L$.\n"
"\n"
"## Key Insight: Inverse Tolerance Scaling\n"
"\n"
"The crucial observation is that:\n"
"\n"
"$|b(n) - 2L| = |2 \\cdot a(n) - 2L| = 2 \\cdot |a(n) - L|$\n"
"\n"
"So if we want $|b(n) - 2L| < \\varepsilon$, we need $2 \\cdot |a(n) - L| < \\varepsilon$, which means $|a(n) - L| < \\varepsilon/2$.\n"
"\n"
"This is exactly what we can get from the convergence of $a$!\n"
"\n"
"## New Tools You'll Need\n"
"\n"
"**Absolute Value of Products**:\n"
"You'll need the new theorem `abs_mul` which states that for any real numbers $x$ and $y$:\n"
"\n"
"$|x \\cdot y| = |x| \\cdot |y|$.\n"
"\n"
"To use this theorem, you may find it convenient to\n"
"make a new hypothesis using `have` and then `rewrite` by that hypothesis. That is, you can say,\n"
"\n"
"`have NewFact : |Something * SomethingElse| =\n"
"|Something| * |SomethingElse| :=\n"
"by apply abs_mul`\n"
"\n"
"and then `rewrite [NewFact]` will replace `|Something * SomethingElse|` by `|Something| * |SomethingElse|` (either at the Goal, or `at` a hypothesis, if you so specify).\n"
"\n"
"## Your Strategic Approach\n"
"\n"
"1. Unfold the definition of convergence for the goal\n"
"2. Given any $\\varepsilon > 0$, use the convergence of $a$ with tolerance $\\varepsilon/2$. You may find it useful to separately prove the inequality `0 < ε / 2` -- which\n"
"tactic do you think will help with that?\n"
"3. Extract the witness $N$ from the convergence of $a$\n"
"4. Use the same $N$ for your sequence $b$\n"
"5. Apply the scaling hypothesis and use `abs_mul` to relate $|b(n) - 2L|$ to $|a(n) - L|$\n"
"6. Use the convergence bound for $a$ to conclude\n"
"\n"
"## Why This Pattern Matters\n"
"\n"
"This proof introduces the important technique of **inverse scaling** for tolerances. When you scale a sequence by a constant $c$, you need to scale your tolerance demands by $1/c$. This principle will appear again when you study:\n"
"- Products of sequences (where both factors contribute to the error)\n"
"- Derivatives (where the limit definition involves scaling by $h$)\n"
"- Integration (where Riemann sums involve scaling by partition widths)\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"The key insight is that subsequences can only \"spread out\" indices, never compress them. Since `σ(n) ≥ n` always, if `a` is eventually within `ε` of `L` (for all indices ≥ N), then `a ∘ σ` is too—because `σ` maps `n ≥ N` to even larger indices where `a` is still close to `L`.\n"

"\n"
"By contrapositive: *If there exist two subsequences converging to different limits, then `a` does not converge.*\n"
"\n"
"This is a powerful tool for proving divergence!\n"
"\n"
"**Example Application:**\n"
"\n"
"Consider `a n = (-1)^n`, which oscillates between -1 and 1:\n"
"- The even-indexed subsequence: `a(0), a(2), a(4), ... = 1, 1, 1, ...` converges to 1\n"
"- The odd-indexed subsequence: `a(1), a(3), a(5), ... = -1, -1, -1, ...` converges to -1\n"
"\n"
"Since we have subsequences converging to different limits (1 and -1), the sequence `a n = (-1)^n` does not converge. We'll see this in the next level!\n"
"\n"
"**Looking Ahead:**\n"

"Subsequences are fundamental in analysis:\n"
"- **Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem:** Every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence\n"
"- **Compactness:** Sequential compactness is defined using subsequences\n"
"- **Cauchy sequences:** Can be understood through subsequences\n"
"- **limsup and liminf:** Defined as limits of monotone subsequences\n"
"\n"
"The concept generalizes to metric spaces and topological spaces, where it's crucial for understanding convergence and compactness.\n"

"Often in mathematics, you'll be given a hypothesis that contains multiple pieces of information bundled together. For instance, you might know that \"x = 2 AND y = 3\" but only need the fact that \"y = 3\" for your current goal. Rather than using lengthy tactics to unpack this information, Lean provides an elegant shorthand: dot notation.\n"
"\n"
"Think of dot notation like accessing specific files in a well-organized filing cabinet. If you have a folder labeled `h` that contains multiple documents, you can quickly grab the second document with `h.2` instead of having to open the folder, sort through all the papers, and extract what you need manually.\n"
"\n"
"This notation becomes especially powerful when dealing with complex mathematical objects. In real analysis, we often work with properties that have multiple components—a sequence might be both bounded AND monotonic, or a function might be both continuous AND differentiable.

"This is a great example of when proof by contradiction is the natural approach. We want to prove `L ≤ K`, which is hard to show directly. But assuming `L > K` gives us a concrete positive number `L - K` that we can use as `ε` in the convergence definition. The contradiction writes itself!\n"

"\n"
"Congratulations! You've just established one of the most important foundational results in\n"
"analysis: **limits are unique**.\n"
"\n"
"This theorem justifies our use of the definite article—we can speak of \"**the** limit\"\n"
"of a sequence rather than \"**a** limit.\" Without uniqueness, the entire theory of limits\n"
"would be ambiguous and potentially inconsistent.\n"
"\n"
"## Why Uniqueness Matters\n"
"\n"
"The uniqueness of limits is fundamental to the entire edifice of analysis. It ensures that:\n"
"\n"
"- When we define continuous functions using limits, the definitions are unambiguous\n"
"- Limit notation like `lim_{n→∞} a(n) = L` is well-defined\n"
"- We can safely use limits in computations without worrying about multiple possible values\n"
"- Many standard theorems that rely on \"the limit\" make sense\n"
"\n"
"## The Power of Contradiction\n"
"\n"
"This proof also showcased the power of **proof by contradiction** (`by_contra`). When\n"
"direct proof seems difficult, assuming the opposite and deriving an impossibility can be\n"
"an elegant and effective strategy. You'll use this technique many times throughout\n"
"analysis.\n"
"\n"
"The key insight was geometric: if two points are separated by distance `d`, then no third\n"
"point can be within distance `d/2` of both. This simple observation, made rigorous through\n"
"epsilon-N arguments, gave us our contradiction."

"**The Deeper Insight:**\n"
"Notice how the proof required more than just intuition. The 'obvious' fact that sums of convergent sequences converge needed careful epsilon management. This is the hallmark of rigorous analysis: making intuitive ideas completely precise.\n"
"\n"
"## Check in, in Natural Language\n"
"\n"
"Yet again, let's step back from the formal Lean proof and understand what we just proved in plain English.\n"
"\n"
"**Theorem (in natural language):** If two sequences of real numbers converge to their respective limits, then the sequence formed by adding corresponding terms also converges, and its limit is the sum of the original limits.\n"
"\n"
"**Proof:** Suppose sequences $a(n)$ and $b(n)$ converge to $L$ and $M$ respectively, and we want to show that $c(n) = a(n) + b(n)$ converges to $L + M$.\n"
"\n"
"By definition, we need to show that for any tolerance $\\varepsilon > 0$, we can find a point $N$ such that for all $n \\geq N$, we have $|c(n) - (L + M)| < \\varepsilon$.\n"
"\n"
"Since $a(n)$ converges to $L$, we can find $N_1$ such that $|a(n) - L| < \\varepsilon/2$ for all $n \\geq N_1$.\n"
"Since $b(n)$ converges to $M$, we can find $N_2$ such that $|b(n) - M| < \\varepsilon/2$ for all $n \\geq N_2$.\n"
"\n"
"Let $N = N_1 + N_2$ (any number that's at least as large as both $N_1$ and $N_2$ would work). Then for any $n \\geq N$:\n"
"\n"
"$$|c(n) - (L + M)| = |(a(n) + b(n)) - (L + M)| = |(a(n) - L) + (b(n) - M)|$$\n"
"\n"
"By the triangle inequality, this is at most:\n"
"$$|a(n) - L| + |b(n) - M| < \\frac{\\varepsilon}{2} + \\frac{\\varepsilon}{2} = \\varepsilon$$\n"

"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** So far we've learned that *if* a sequence converges, then it's bounded, and moreover that any subsequence of it also converges to the same limit.\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Yeah, so what?\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** And we saw that there can be sequences which do not themselves converge -- for example, $(-1)^n$ -- but which are bounded and have subsequences that do converge. The even-indexed terms, in this example, are all equal 1.\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** What are you getting at?\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Well, what's a question that a mathematician might naturally ask given that information?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** You mean whether that always happens?\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Yes, something like that. Can you elaborate?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Okay, I'll play along. You're trying to get me to formulate some kind of converse. If a sequence is bounded, then... it converges? No, that can't be right -- a bounded sequence can bounce around without converging, like $(-1)^n$ itself.\n"
"\n"
"Ah, but maybe there's always *some* subsequence that converges? Hmm, but that can't be right either, since the sequence `aₙ = n` has no convergent subsequence -- it just escapes to infinity.\n"
"\n"
"Oh! But wait, that sequence isn't bounded. Are you saying that if all I know about a sequence is that it's bounded, then there's always *some* subsequence that converges?\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Yes, precisely! This important fact is called the \"Bolzano-Weierstrauss theorem\". But here's where it gets **really** subtle. Think about the sequence of fractions: `a (0) = 1 / 1`, `a (1) = 14 / 10`, `a (2) = 141 / 100`, `a (3) = 1414 / 1000`, ... getting closer and closer to $1.4142\\dots = \\sqrt 2$. The sequence is bounded (by $2$, to be crude), and even increasing, but its limit is not a rational number! So the Bolzno-Weierstrauss theorem is not true for the rationals. As I warned you long ago, we'll have to eventually face the fact that we don't even know what the real numbers *are*. I think that time is now.\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Fine, I'm ready; tell me what they are.\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Unfortunately, it's rather complicated, and it'll take us some time to arrive at the answer, and to see why it *is* the answer. Let's take a step back. What would you *like* to be able to say about the real numbers?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Well, I guess I'd like to say something like: they're the limits of their decimal expansions. So they're limits of rational sequences. Like, $\\sqrt{2}$ is the limit of that sequence you just mentioned: $1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, \\dots$\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Good! So you want to define a real number as \"the limit of a sequence of rationals.\" But remind me, what does it mean for a sequence to have a limit?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** It means that for all `ε > 0`, there exists an `N`, yadda yadda. The terms get arbitrarily close to some number $L$.\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** And what is this mysterious number $L$? What *type* of number it?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** It's... a real number. Oh no.\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Exactly! We have a circular definition. We're trying to define the real numbers as limits of rational sequences, but the very notion of \"limit\" that we've been using presupposes that we already know what the real numbers are!\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** So we're stuck? We can't define the real numbers?\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Sure seems like it! But this is where Cauchy had a **brilliant** insight. He realized the same thing you did: he can't use real numbers to define limits. He wants to say: \"$a_n$ gets closer and closer to $L$\" but without reference to $L$ itself. He needs to find *something else* that he can say $a_n$ gets close to.\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** But he *has* nothing else.\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Exactly!! So...?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** So if all he has is the sequence $a_n$, and he has to compare it to something, and he has nothing else... Oh!!! He has to compare it to **itself**!?! But how?\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Wow, you got it! Yes, exactly, How?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Well of course it's pointless to ask if `|aₙ - aₙ| < ε`. But... you could ask for `|aₙ - aₘ| < ε`, once `n` and `m` are *both* large enough?\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Ha, you did it! Yes, exactly, if $a_n$ and $a_m$ are both within $\\varepsilon$ of **each other**, that should be a substitute for convergence.\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** That's so clever! So instead of saying \"the sequence converges to $L$,\" we say \"the terms of the sequence get arbitrarily close to each other\"?\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Precisely. Can you make this formal, using `ε`'s and `N`'s?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** I think so. I guess we should say that a sequence $a_n$ has a limit if: for every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists an $N$ such that for all $m, n \\geq N$, we have $|a_m - a_n| < \\varepsilon$.\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Beautiful! But since we already have a different meaning for the notion of  \"has a limit\", we'll call this property \"Cauchy\". So we say that **a sequence is Cauchy** if, as you said:\n"
"\n"
"`∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ m ≥ N, ∀ n ≥ N, |a m - a n| < ε`\n"
"\n"
"This is one of the most important definitions in **all of mathematics**.\n"
"It appears not only here in real analysis, but also in higher arithmetic when building the p-adic numbers, in functional analysis when studying Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces, and in topology and geometry when \"completing\" metric spaces. Anywhere mathematicians want to talk about  \"convergence\" but without knowing *a priori* where things converge *to*, they reach for a version of Cauchy's definition.\n"
"\n"
"But before we return to the real numbers, let's first get more familiar\n"

"\n"
"## Natural Language Proof of the Archimedean Property\n"
"\n"
"**Theorem**: For any positive real number ε > 0, there exists a natural number N such that 1 / ε < N.\n"
"\n"
"**Proof**:\n"
"Let ε > 0 be given. We need to find a natural number N such that 1 / ε < N.\n"
"\n"
"Use the value N = ⌈1 / ε⌉₊ + 1, where ⌈·⌉₊ denotes the natural number ceiling function.\n"
"\n"
"Since ε > 0, we have 1 / ε > 0. By the definition of the natural number ceiling function, we know that:\n"
"\n"
"1 / ε ≤ ⌈1 / ε⌉₊\n"
"\n"
"Now, since ⌈1 / ε⌉₊ is a natural number and N = ⌈1 / ε⌉₊ + 1, we have:\n"
"\n"
"⌈1 / ε⌉₊ < ⌈1 / ε⌉₊ + 1 = N\n"
"\n"
"Combining these inequalities, we get that:\n"
"\n"
"1 / ε ≤ ⌈1 / ε⌉₊ < N\n"
"\n"
"Therefore, 1 / ε < N, which completes the proof. □\n"
"\n"
"**Significance**: The Archimedean Property is fundamental to analysis because it ensures that the real numbers have no \"infinite\" or \"infinitesimal\" elements. It guarantees that we can always find natural numbers large enough to dominate any given positive real number when we take their reciprocals. This property is essential for many limit processes and is equivalent to the completeness of the real numbers in certain formulations of real analysis.\n"
"\n"
"## Review of Common Pitfalls\n"
"\n"
"- **Don't use the regular ceiling function `⌈·⌉`** - it returns integers, not natural numbers!\n"
"- **Watch out for casting issues** - if `bound` isn't working, try `push_cast` first\n"
"- **The addition `⌈1 / ε⌉₊ + 1` happens in `ℕ`**, then gets cast to `ℝ` - this is why we need `push_cast`\n"
"\n"
"**Historical Note**: While often attributed to Archimedes (c. 287-212 BCE), this property was likely known to Eudoxus (c. 408-355 BCE) and appears in Euclid's *Elements*. Archimedes used a version of this principle in his method of exhaustion, particularly in calculating areas and volumes by approximating them with polygons of increasing numbers of sides."

"## The Need for `by_cases`\n"
"\n"
"You've already learned how to use `cases'` to handle disjunctions when you have a hypothesis\n"
"`h : P ∨ Q`. This allows you to split your proof into two branches: one where you assume `P`\n"
"is true, and another where you assume `Q` is true.\n"
"\n"
"But what if you need to perform case analysis on a statement that isn't already among your\n"
"hypotheses? Sometimes you need to consider whether a certain proposition is true or false,\n"
"even when you haven't been explicitly told which case holds.\n"
"\n"
"This is where the **law of excluded middle** comes in: for any proposition `P`, either `P` is\n"
"true or `¬P` is true. The `by_cases` tactic allows you to exploit this fundamental logical\n"
"principle directly in your proofs.\n"
"\n"
"Just so you know: the law of excluded middle is somewhat controversial in certain mathematical\n"
"circles. \"Constructivist\" mathematicians argue that to prove `P ∨ ¬P`, you should need to either\n"
"construct a proof of `P` or construct a proof of `¬P`, not merely assert that one of these must be true.\n"
"However, among mainstream mathematicians (and in classical logic, which Lean allows),\n"
"the law of excluded middle is accepted without question. For our purposes in real analysis,\n"
"we'll use it freely, as it's an incredibly powerful and natural tool for organizing proofs.\n"
"\n"
"## How by_cases Works\n"
"\n"
"The `by_cases` tactic has the syntax:\n"
"\n"
"`by_cases h : fact`\n"
"\n"
"where `h` is the name you choose for the new hypothesis, and `fact` is the proposition you\n"
"want to analyze. This creates two subgoals:\n"
"- **First subgoal:** Assume `fact` is true, giving you hypothesis `h : fact`\n"
"- **Second subgoal:** Assume `fact` is false, giving you hypothesis `h : ¬fact`\n"
"\n"
"You must prove your goal in both cases.\n"
"\n"
"## When to Use by_cases\n"
"\n"
"Use `by_cases` when:\n"
"- You need to consider whether some condition holds, but it's not already a hypothesis\n"
"- Different proof strategies apply depending on whether a statement is true or false\n"
"- You need to handle edge cases (like checking if a number equals zero)\n"
"- You want to prove a theorem with weaker assumptions by splitting into cases\n"
"\n"
"## A Motivating Example\n"
"\n"
"In this level, we'll prove a generalization of `EventuallyGeHalfLimPos`. The previous version\n"
"required the assumption `L ≠ 0`. But what if we want to prove the result without that\n"
"assumption? We can use `by_cases` to split into two cases:\n"
"- If `L = 0`, the result is trivially true (since `|L|/2 = 0`)\n"
"- If `L ≠ 0`, we can apply our previous theorem\n"
"\n"
"This demonstrates how `by_cases` allows us to handle all possibilities systematically, making\n"

"**SIMPLICIO:** Hey Socrates, I've been thinking about something that's been bothering me. When we prove things in mathematics, we usually prove a specific statement. But what if I want to prove something is true for *all* natural numbers? Like, how do I prove a statement for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on... forever?\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Ah, an excellent question! You're right that we can't just check each case one by one—that would take infinitely long. Tell me, Simplicio, have you ever climbed a ladder?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Of course! What does that have to do with anything?\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Well, imagine an infinitely tall ladder reaching up to the sky. If I wanted to convince you that you *could* climb to any rung on this ladder, what would I need to show you?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Hmm... I guess you'd need to show me that I can reach the bottom-most rung?\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Good start! And what else?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Well, if I'm standing on any particular rung, I'd need to know I can reach the next one up. So if I can always step from one rung to the next...\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Exactly! So if you can reach the first rung, and you can always step from rung `k` to rung `k+1`, then what can you conclude?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Oh! Then I can reach *any* rung I want! If I want to reach rung 100, I just start at rung 0, step to rung 1, then to rung 2, and keep going until I reach rung 100. And the same works for any number!\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Precisely! This is the essence of **mathematical induction**. To prove something is true for all natural numbers `n`, you need exactly two things:\n"
"- A **base case**: prove it's true for `n = 0`\n"
"- An **inductive step**: prove that *if* it's true for `n = k`, *then* it's true for `n = k + 1`\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Wait, but in the inductive step, aren't we assuming what we're trying to prove? Isn't that circular reasoning?\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** An astute observation! But no, it's not circular. We're not assuming the statement is true for all `n`. We're only assuming it's true for one particular value `k`, and using that assumption to prove that it's true for `k + 1`. We're proving an implication: \"if `P(k)` then `P(k+1)`\". Combined with the base case, this creates a chain reaction that reaches any natural number.\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Hmm, I think I see. So the assumption \"it's true for `k`\" is called the inductive hypothesis?\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Exactly! And that hypothesis is your most powerful tool. It's like having a foothold on rung `k` that you can push off from to reach rung `k + 1`.\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** But why does this work? I mean, why should I believe this principle?\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Ah, a deep question! It comes from the very definition of the natural numbers themselves. How do you think the natural numbers are constructed?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Well... I guess we start with 0. And then we have 1, which is 0 + 1. And 2 is 1 + 1. So each number is the \"successor\" of the previous one?\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Beautiful! The natural numbers are defined by exactly this process:\n"
"- Zero is a natural number\n"
"- If `k` is a natural number, then `k + 1` is also a natural number\n"
"- These are the *only* natural numbers\n"
"\n"
"Do you see how this mirrors the structure of induction?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Oh wow! The base case corresponds to \"zero is a natural number,\" and the inductive step corresponds to \"if `k` is a natural number, then so is `k + 1`.\" Induction is just the construction of the natural numbers turned into a proof technique!\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Precisely! There are no \"gaps\" in the natural numbers—no number that can't be reached by starting at 0 and repeatedly adding 1. This is why induction works.\n"
"\n"
"In fact, this is not just a philosophical observation—this is *literally* how the natural numbers are implemented in Lean! In Lean's type theory, a natural number is defined inductively as either:\n"
"- `zero : ℕ`, the base case, or\n"
"- `succ n : ℕ`, the successor of another natural number `n`\n"
"\n"
"Here's how this looks in the core of Lean:\n"
"\n"
"`inductive Nat where`\n"
"- `| zero : Nat`\n"
"- `| succ (n : Nat) : Nat`\n"
"\n"
"You simply declare the existence of a natural number called `zero`, and then we declare that, given any natural number `n`, there's another one called `succ n`. (The word `succ` is here just a name for this constructor; we could have called it `Alice` instead. The important thing is that we're giving a way to construct a new natural number from a previously existing one.)\n"
"\n"
"So the number 3, for instance, is literally represented as `succ (succ (succ zero))`. The principle of induction doesn't just *resemble* this construction, it directly exploits it! When you prove something by induction in Lean, you're working with the actual computational structure of how natural numbers exist in the system.\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** That's amazing! So induction isn't just a proof technique—it's baked into the very fabric of how Lean understands numbers?\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Exactly. The principle of mathematical induction is a theorem in many mathematical frameworks, but in type theory, it's a fundamental consequence of how the natural numbers are defined.\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Okay, I'm convinced this is a legitimate proof technique. Can you give me an example?\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Certainly."

"In formal notation: `∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, |a(n) - L| < ε`\n"
"\n"
"For our specific case with `a(n) = 1 / n` and `L = 0`, this becomes:\n"

"## The Natural Language Proof Strategy\n"
"\n"
"Here's how we'll prove this step by step:\n"
"\n"
"**Step 1**: Let `ε > 0` be given. (This will correspond to `intro ε hε`)\n"
"\n"
"**Step 2**: We need to find `N` such that for all `n ≥ N`, we have `1 / n < ε`.\n"
"\n"
"**Key insight**: We need `1 / n < ε`, which is equivalent to `1 / ε < n` (since both sides are positive). So we need `n` to be larger than `1 / ε`.\n"
"When our Engineer requests the tolerance of `ε = 1/100`, the Machinist replies, ok, I can do that, but I'll need `N = 1 / ε = 100` days in my factory.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"**Step 3**: That's exactly why we developed the Archimedean Property! It tells us that there exists some natural number `N` such that `1 / ε < N`.\n"
"Rather than reproving that from scratch, we can simply quote this fact;\n"
"then\n"
"we'll choose such an `N` and use it.\n"
"\n"
"**Step 4**: Now let `n ≥ N` be given. We have:\n"
"- `1 / ε < N` (by our choice of `N`)\n"
"- `N ≤ n` (by assumption)\n"
"- Therefore: `1 / ε < N ≤ n`, so `1 / ε < n`\n"
"- Taking reciprocals (and flipping the inequality): `1 / n < ε`\n"
"\n"
"**Step 5**: Since `|1 / n - 0| = |1 / n| = 1 / n < ε`, we're done! □\n"
"\n"
"## The Lean Implementation Challenges\n"
"\n"
"### Challenge 1: Cross-Multiplying Fractions\n"
"Our key step is showing that `1 / n < ε`. In paper mathematics, we'd simply cross-multiply to get `1 < n * ε`. But Lean is very careful about division by zero, so we can't just cross-multiply willy-nilly.\n"
"\n"
"**The Problem**: We want to go from `1 / n < ε` to `1 < n * ε`, but this is only valid if `n > 0` and `ε > 0`.\n"
"\n"
"**Solution**: The `field_simp` tactic handles this automatically! It will clear denominators by cross-multiplying, but only after it can verify that all denominators are positive (or at least non-zero).\n"
"\n"
"### Challenge 2: Linear Arithmetic\n"
"Once we've cleared the fractions, we need to combine various inequalities like:\n"
"- `1 / ε < N` (from the Archimedean Property)\n"
"- `N ≤ n` (our assumption)\n"
"- `1 < n * ε` (our goal after clearing denominators)\n"
"\n"
"For some reason, the `bound` tactic doesn't always handle these linear combinations well, especially when they involve multiplication by variables.\n"
"\n"
"**Solution**: The `linarith` tactic is specifically designed for linear arithmetic. It can take a list of hypotheses and solve goals that follow from linear combinations of those hypotheses.\n"
"\n"
"### Challenge 3: Explicit Type Casting\n"
"Remember those mysterious up arrows `↑` from the last level? They're back! When we write `1 / n`, Lean sees this as `1 / ↑n` where `n` starts as a natural number but needs to be cast as a real number.\n"
"\n"
"Sometimes we have to be specific about what type of casting to use. The expression `1 / ↑n` could be ambiguous—are we casting to integers, rationals, reals, or something else?\n"
"\n"
"**Solution**: Instead of an up arrow, we can specify the casting explicitly with this syntax: `(n : ℝ)`. This tells Lean exactly what type we want to cast `n` to, in this case, the reals. This eliminates ambiguity and makes your proofs more precise.\n"
"\n"
"### Challenge 4: Casting in Tactic Applications\n"
"Sometimes you want to apply a tactic or theorem, but the types don't quite match because of casting issues. For example, you might have the hypothesis that `N ≤ n` where `n, N` are naturals, but `bound` or `linarith` are searching for a proof that `(N : ℝ) ≤ (n : ℝ)` as reals.\n"
"\n"
"**Solution**: The `exact_mod_cast` tactic is like `apply`, but it automatically handles the type coercions for you. If you're trying to prove `(N : ℝ) ≤ (n : ℝ)`, and you have the hypothesis `h : N ≤ n` (as naturals), then you can write: `exact_mod_cast h`. Lean will look at `h`\n"
"and realize, oh it's exactly what you're trying to prove, but just\n"
"cast to a different number system; and it'll figure out the proof from there.\n"
"\n"
"## New Tools You'll Need\n"
"\n"
"- **`field_simp`**: Clears denominators by cross-multiplying, but only when it can prove the denominators are non-zero. This is the key to handling fractional inequalities safely.\n"
"\n"
"- **Arithmetic with inequalities**: You might also find the `linarith` tactic helpful. It is a very powerful, general tactic like `ring_nf`, but instead of proving algebraic *identities*, it proves *inequalities* involving \"linear arithmetic\" on the specified hypotheses. For example,\n"
"if you have as hypotheses: `h₁ : X ≤ Y`, `h₂ : 2 * Y ≤ Z`,\n"
"and your Goal is to prove that `2 * X ≤ Z`, then\n"
"simply calling `linarith [h₁, h₂]` will do the trick. So add as many inequality hypotheses to your Game Board as you may need, and then call `linarith` on them to prove a Goal. I find that `linarith` is best called at the very end, when you've assembled all your facts and are ready to close a Goal (but it has many other uses as well, as you'll see).\n"
"\n"
"- **Explicit casting `(n : ℝ)`**: Tells Lean exactly what type to use, eliminating ambiguity in expressions like `1 / n`. You only need to cast\n"
"once in any expression, and Lean will automatically cast everything else.\n"
"For example, you can say `(0 : ℝ) < N`, and Lean will figure out that\n"
"the `0` you mean is a real number, and so, to compare that with `N`,\n"
"the latter too must be cast to the reals.\n"
"\n"
"- **`exact_mod_cast`**: Automatically handles type coercions between different number types (ℕ, ℤ, ℚ, ℝ), when the Goal is *exactly*\n"
"what you're trying to prove, just needs to get coerced.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"## Pro Tips for This Level\n"
"\n"
"1. **Use `change`** to convert `SeqLim a 0` to its definition\n"
"2. **Apply the Archimedean Property** to get the existence of an `N`\n"
"3. **Use `choose`** to extract the `N` from the existential statement\n"
"4. **Establish positivity first** before using `field_simp`\n"
"5. **Work step by step** - don't try to do everything at once!\n"
"\n"
"## What Makes This Non-Trivial?\n"
"\n"
"Unlike the constant sequence (which was essentially definitional), this proof requires:\n"
"- **The Archimedean Property** to find a suitable `N`\n"
"- **Careful type management** between `ℕ` and `ℝ`\n"
"- **Positivity arguments** to handle division\n"
"- **Inequality manipulation** to connect our bounds\n"
"\n"
"This is a perfect example of how even \"obvious\" mathematical facts require sophisticated machinery to prove rigorously!"

"\n"
"You've just proven a fundamental result about finite sums! This theorem might seem simple, but it's a powerful building block that appears throughout analysis.\n"
"\n"
"## What You Accomplished\n"
"\n"
"You successfully proved that **every term is bounded by the total sum**:\n"
"```\n"
"∀ n < N, |a n| ≤ ∑ k ∈ range N, |a k|\n"
"```\n"
"\n"
"### Key Techniques You Mastered:\n"
"\n"
"1. **Strategic induction** - You learned to use induction on `N` *before* introducing the universal quantifier, which made the proof structure much cleaner\n"
"\n"
"2. **Working with finite sums** - You used `sum_range_succ` to peel off terms and `sum_nonneg` to establish nonnegativity\n"
"\n"
"3. **Case analysis** - You split the proof into two cases (`n < N` vs `n = N`) and handled each appropriately\n"
"\n"
"4. **Combining results** - You cleverly used the inductive hypothesis for earlier terms and nonnegativity for the final term\n"
"\n"
"## Why This Matters\n"
"\n"
"This result is essential for the next level! You'll use `TermLeSum` to prove that **convergent sequences are bounded**. Here's the connection:\n"
"\n"
"- Every convergent sequence is eventually close to its limit\n"
"- But what about the finitely many terms *before* it gets close?\n"
"- That's where your theorem comes in! You can bound those initial terms by their finite sum\n"
"- Combine this with the eventual bound, and you get a global bound for the entire sequence\n"
"\n"
"## Looking Ahead\n"
"\n"
"In the next level, you'll prove `BddOfConvNonzero`: convergent sequences with nonzero limits are bounded. This is a cornerstone result in analysis that tells us convergent sequences can't escape to infinity.\n"

"\n"
"This theorem is important because it shows that the Cauchy property is preserved by addition—a crucial fact we'll need when we eventually define the real numbers!\n"
"\n"
"## The Setup\n"

"- `a : ℕ → ℝ` is Cauchy\n"
"- `b : ℕ → ℝ` is Cauchy\n"
"\n"
"Prove: `a + b` is Cauchy\n"
"\n"
"## Strategy\n"
"\n"
"This proof follows a familiar pattern from the sum of limits theorem:\n"
"\n"
"1. **Split epsilon**: Apply the Cauchy property to both `a` and `b` using `ε/2`\n"
"2. **Take the maximum N**: Use `N₁ + N₂` to ensure both Cauchy conditions hold\n"
"3. **Change the goal**: Express `|(a + b)ₘ - (a + b)ₙ|` as `|(aₘ - aₙ) + (bₘ - bₙ)|`\n"
"4. **Triangle inequality**: Split the sum into two pieces\n"
"5. **Combine estimates**: Each piece is less than `ε / 2`, so the total is less than `ε`\n"
"\n"
"## Key Insight\n"
"\n"
"The beauty of the Cauchy property is that we don't need to know *where* the sequences converge—we only need to know that their terms get close to *each other*. This self-referential definition makes the proof very similar to the sum of limits, but without ever mentioning a limit!\n"

"\n"
"The key is to use the convergence condition with `ε = |L| / 2`:\n"
"\n"
"1. Since `L ≠ 0`, we have `|L| > 0`, so `ε = |L| / 2` is a valid positive epsilon\n"
"2. Convergence gives us `N` such that `|a (n) - L| < |L| / 2` for all `n ≥ N`\n"
"3. This means `a (n)` is within distance `|L| / 2` of `L`\n"
"4. By the reverse triangle inequality, this forces `|a (n)| ≥ |L| / 2`\n"
"\n"
"The algebraic key is recognizing that:\n"
"$$|L| = |a (n) + (L - a (n))| \\leq |a (n)| + |L - a (n)| < |a (n)| + \\frac{|L|}{2}$$\n"

You'll master the fundamental logical operations that appear everywhere in mathematics—working with \"and\" statements, \"or\" statements, and the connections between them. These aren't just abstract logical exercises; they're the building blocks that make complex proofs manageable and clear.\n"
"\n"
"**What You'll Accomplish:**\n"
"\n"
"First, you'll develop fluency with Lean's logical tactics: constructing conjunctions with `split_ands`, making strategic choices with `left` and `right`, extracting information with dot notation, and handling case analysis with `cases'`. These form a complete toolkit for navigating the logical landscape of mathematical proof.\n"
"\n"
"Then you'll apply these tools to prove one of the most elegant and powerful results in analysis: the **Squeeze Theorem**. This theorem beautifully demonstrates how logical reasoning and analytical insight combine to create mathematical magic. When you trap a sequence between two others that converge to the same limit, the trapped sequence has no choice but to converge there too!\n"

"You'll see how the abstract logical operations you learn connect directly to concrete analytical reasoning. The same `split_ands` technique that helps you break down complex goals will help you extract bounds from convergence conditions. The `abs_lt` theorem will bridge the gap between absolute value statements and ordinary inequalities, giving you the tools to work with epsilon-N definitions effectively.\n"

"\n"
"Welcome to a new world of mathematics: **finite sums**! In this level, you'll prove that any individual term in a sum of absolute values is bounded by the total sum. This is a fundamental property that bridges discrete and continuous mathematics.\n"
"\n"
"## The Goal\n"
"\n"
"Prove that for any sequence `a : ℕ → ℝ` and natural number `N`, every term `|a n|` with `n < N` is at most the sum `∑ k ∈ range N, |a k|`.\n"
"\n"
"Intuitively: if you're adding up a bunch of nonnegative numbers, no single number can be bigger than the total!\n"
"\n"
"## Strategy: Induction from the Start!\n"
"\n"
"🎯 **Big Hint:** Even though the goal starts with `∀ n < N`, do **NOT** begin with `intro n hn`. Instead, run **induction on `N`** right from the beginning!\n"
"\n"
"This might feel counterintuitive, but trust the process. Induction gives you the perfect structure to peel off one term at a time using `sum_range_succ`.\n"
"\n"
"### Your Induction Strategy:\n"
"- **Base case (`N = 0`):** There are no natural numbers less than 0, so you'll get a `contradiction`\n"
"- **Inductive step (`N → N + 1`):** Use `sum_range_succ` to write the sum for `N + 1` as the sum for `N` plus the new term `|a N|`\n"
"  - Split into cases: Is `n < N` (use inductive hypothesis) or `n = N` (use nonnegativity)?\n"
"\n"
"## New Tools You'll Need\n"
"\n"
"### Summation Notation\n"
"`∑ k ∈ range N` means sum as `k` goes from `0` to `N - 1` (which has `N` terms total!)\n"
"\n"
"### `sum_range_succ`\n"
"Peels off the last term: `∑ k ∈ range (N + 1), f k = (∑ k ∈ range N, f k) + f N`\n"

"### `sum_nonneg`\n"
"If each term is nonnegative, so is the sum. Usage: `apply sum_nonneg`, then prove `∀ k ∈ range N, 0 ≤ f k`\n"
"\n"
"### `contradiction`\n"
"If your hypotheses are contradictory (like `n : ℕ` with `n < 0`), this tactic closes the goal immediately.\n"
"\n"
"### `by_cases`\n"
"Split into cases based on a decidable proposition. Usage: `by_cases h : n < N` creates two goals:\n"

"\n"
"This proof introduced several key techniques:\n"
"\n"
"**Combining Proof Methods:** You used `induction'` as the overall structure, but within the inductive step, you needed `by_cases` to handle different scenarios. This is a common pattern: induction provides the framework, but you often need other tactics to complete the argument.\n"

"**Handling Edge Cases:** The `k = 0` case required separate treatment because the inequality `k + 1 ≤ 2k` doesn't hold when `k = 0`. Recognizing when to split cases is an essential skill in mathematical proof.\n"
"\n"
"**Building Inequality Chains:** In the `k ≠ 0` case, you constructed a chain of inequalities: `k + 1 ≤ 2k < 2 · 2^k = 2^(k+1)`. Using the inductive hypothesis `k < 2^k` along with `1 ≤ k` allowed you to bridge from `k + 1` to `2^(k+1)`.\n"
"\n"
"## The Power of Induction\n"
"\n"
"Mathematical induction is one of the most versatile proof techniques. It's essential for:\n"
"- Proving formulas like `∑(i=1 to n) i = n(n+1)/2`\n"
"- Establishing inequalities involving factorials, exponentials, and recursive sequences\n"
"- Verifying properties of recursively defined structures\n"
"- Proving algorithm correctness in computer science\n"
"\n"
"## Key Insight\n"

"1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, ...\n"
"\n"
"Does this converge or not???\n"
"\n"
"Some people said, well, you go up one then down one, so on average, it's around zero. So the limit should be 0.\n"
"\n"
"Other people said: look at the partial sums of the sequence:\n"
"\n"
"1 = 1\n"
"\n"
"1 + (-1) = 0\n"
"\n"
"1 + (-1) + 1 = 1\n"
"\n"
"1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) = 0\n"
"\n"
"Ah so the partial sums alternate between 1 and 0, so maybe the limit is 1/2!\n"
"\n"
"This is the kind of trouble you get into if you don't have a community consensus on what the definitions of things are, namely, if you don't have a rigorous definition of limit. Luckily, we now do!\n"
"\n"
"With that definition, this sequence .... does not have a limit (\"diverges\").\n"
"\n"
"In order to express that formally, let's make a new definition:\n"
"\n"
"`def SeqConv (a : ℕ → ℝ) : Prop := ∃ L, SeqLim a L`\n"
"\n"
"That is, a sequence `a` \"converges\" (without specifying to what), if there indeed exists some real number `L`\n"
"so that `a` converges to that number.\n"
"\n"
"In this level, then, our goal is to prove:\n"
"\n"
"`Goal : ¬ SeqConv a`,\n"
"\n"
"given the assumption `ha : ∀ n, a n = (-1 : ℝ) ^ n`. (Note that the \"not\" symbol, `¬`, is obtained by typing\n"
"`\\not`.)\n"
"\n"
"How do you prove the negation of something? Logically speaking, you would say, well, if that thing did happen, then we'd have a contradiction. Technically, `¬ P` is definitionally equivalent to: `P → False`.\n"

"So we could start our proof by reminding ourselves of this fact, by typing:\n"

"`change SeqConv a → False`\n"

"1) Think. Do scratchwork, get a vague sense of how to piece the argument together.\n"
"\n"
"2) Then prove it formally. You're NOT done! Just because you proved it formally doesn't *necessarily* mean that you really understand what's going on! The goal of mathematics is *not* that it just works, but rather that you **understand** exactly what's going on. So step 3 is:\n"
"\n"
"3) Give a natural language proof that explains (to yourself, as much as to anyone else, including me) what's going on and why.\n"

"Remember the Engineer and Mechanic: the Engineer gets to specify any tolerance, and the Mechanic has to guarantee that we'll be within that tolerance \"eventually\", that is, for all large enough `n`, as measured by the lower bound `N`.\n"
"\n"
"**Key Idea:** Find an `ε` that is too tight a tolerance, and the Mechanic will never be able to get within that specification. Because the sequence alternates between `1` and `-1`, which differ by `2`, the tolerance `ε = 1` would already be enough, but just to be safe, let's give ourselves a little more room, and set `ε = 1/2`.\n"
"\n"
"Note: Had we set `ε = 1.5`, that would *not* work. We can't rule out the possibility that `L= 0`, and both values `1` and `-1` *are* indeed within that tolerance. So we won't find a contradiction that way.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"After a bunch of computation, we reached the following:\n"

In mathematics, it would be extraordinarily tedious to manually write on the blackboard the entire goal state after every move, keeping track of all the hypotheses and their relationships by hand. A theorem prover does this bookkeeping for you automatically, letting you focus on the mathematical content rather than the clerical work.\n"
"\n"
"But! This is, as we've already noted, a double-edged sword. We still want to train our brains to \"see\" a mental model of the goal state evolving - good chess players can visualize many moves ahead precisely because they've learned to maintain multiple mental game boards simultaneously. But until you develop that skill, and even after you have it, there's immense value in being able to instantly generate the current \"game board\" of your proof state. The immediate feedback helps you understand the consequences of each logical move, building the very intuition that will eventually let you work more independently. It's the difference between learning to navigate by always checking your GPS versus eventually developing an internal sense of direction - both have their place, and the former helps develop the latter."

"limit. This is a manifestation of the **continuity** of the absolute value function.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"## What We're Proving\n"
"\n"
"**Theorem:** If `a : ℕ → ℝ` converges to `L`, and `b : ℕ → ℝ` is defined by\n"

"A function `f : ℝ → ℝ` is called \"Lipschitz\"  (with constant `K`) if we have `|f(x) - f(y)| ≤ K · |x - y|` for all `x` and `y`. This means the function can't change too rapidly—the output values can't get farther apart than `K` times the input distance.  The theorem `abs_Lipschitz`  states that for any real numbers `x` and `y`:\n"
"$$||x| - |y|| \\leq |x - y|$$\n"

"\n"
"1. Given `ε > 0`, use convergence of `a` to get `N` such that `|a n - L| < ε` for `n ≥ N`\n"
"2. For `n ≥ N`, observe that `b n = |a n|`\n"

One of the most fundamental ideas in analysis is that 'nice operations preserve convergence.' If two sequences each converge, then their sum also converges, and converges to the sum of their limits.\n"
"\n"
"This might seem obvious at first -- after all, if $a(n)$ is getting close to $L$ and $b(n)$ is getting close to $M$, shouldn't $a(n) + b(n)$ get close to $L + M$? While the intuition is correct, making this rigorous requires some clever maneuvering with our epsilon-N definition.\n"

"Here's the key insight: if an engineer demands that our combined output be within $\\varepsilon$ of the target $L + M$, we can't just demand that each factory independently meet the full tolerance $\\varepsilon$. Instead, we need to be clever about how we allocate our 'tolerance budget.'\n"
"\n"

This is the heart of the proof!\n"

In Lean's underlying logic (\"dependent type theory\"), there's actually a deep unity here that mathematicians call the *Curry-Howard correspondence*: propositions are \"Types\", and proofs are \"Terms\" of those Types. This means that introducing a hypothesis is really just introducing a term of a certain type, just like introducing a variable.\n"

When we write `intro ε` and `intro h`, we're literally defining this function by saying \"given these inputs, here's how to compute the output.\" In this view, all of mathematics -- from the simplest definitions to proofs of the deepest theorems -- is secretly just **functions** transforming inputs into outputs!\n"

"a (2), \\dots$.\n"
"\n"
"Now, the definition that mathematicians eventually came up with\n"
"for what it means for a sequence to converge, was so intricate (at least\n"
"at first sight) that it had to be invented *twice*!\n"
"The eventual formulation crystallized through the work of Karl Weierstrass in the 1860s, who transformed analysis from an intuitive art into a rigorous science. However, the seeds of this idea appeared much earlier in the work of Bernard Bolzano. In the 1810s and 1820s, Bolzano was developing remarkably modern ideas about continuity and limits, but he was too far ahead of his time for the mathematical community to accept these abstract concepts.\n"
"Only by Weierstrass's time -- a half-century later -- did these ideas catch on.\n"

"\n"
"Given a sequence `a : ℕ → ℝ` and a real number `L : ℝ`, we\n"

"For every `ε > 0`, there exists `N : ℕ` such that, for all `n ≥ N`, we have `|a (n) - L| < ε`.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"This definition is probably not the first, or second, or tenth thing you might've come up with.\n"
"But over time, I hope you'll come to see that it\n"
" embodies a beautiful negotiation between precision and effort.\n"
"\n"
" I like to think of it as a conversation between an Engineer and a Machinist. The Engineer arrives with specifications: 'We're going to make this widget, and I need its length to be 1 foot, with an error tolerance\n"
" of 1/100 of an inch'. The Machinist replies: 'Sure, I can do that, but I'll have to run my special equipment for at least 10 hours to guarantee that tolerance.' The Enginner\n"
" replies: 'I'm sorry, I misspoke, can we change the tolerance\n"
" to 1/1000 of an inch?' The Machinist replies: 'Oof, yeah we can do it, but it'll cost ya. I'll need at least 40 hours of operation, but after that, I'll guarantee it.'\n"

"As long as this conversation can continue regardless of *whatever* tolerance `ε > 0` the Engineer requires, with the Machinist\n"

"that at time `n` returns a reading `a (n)` (think: widget length). Our ultimate goal is to make the length `L`. If\n"
"for any tolerance `ε > 0`, no matter how small, there will always exist some minimum\n"
"time `N`, so that, for any future time, `n ≥ N`,\n"
"we are guaranteed to be within that tolerance, `|a (n) - L| < ε`, that's exactly the condition under which we'll\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"Notice something else about the definition: It makes no mention of something happening \"eventually\", or \"at infinity\" or any other wishy-washy squirm words. We have traded the ambiguity of speaking about infinity for the precision of existential and universal quantifiers. No more hand-waving about what happens \"as `n` gets large\" - instead, we have a concrete challenge: given *any* tolerance `ε`, can you find a specific threshold `N`? *That* idea was the key breakthrough that allowed Calculus to enter the realm of rigorous mathematics.\n"

"**Proof Strategy:**\n"
"\n"
"This one is surprisingly simple! Given `ε > 0`:\n"
"- Use convergence of `a` to find `N` such that `|a m - L| < ε` for all `m ≥ N`\n"
"- For any `n ≥ N`, note that `σ(n) ≥ n ≥ N` (by `SubseqGe`)\n"

"\n"
"If a sequence has two subsequences converging to **different limits**, then the sequence itself **does not converge**! This gives us a new way to prove divergence. (See Lecture 10 Exercises.)"

"\n"
"While `split_ands` was about being comprehensive—proving every part of a conjunction—proving an \"or\" statement (\"disjunction\") is about making a strategic choice. When faced with proving \"P or Q,\" you don't need to prove both `P` and `Q`. You just need to prove one of them! This might seem easier, but it requires good mathematical judgment: which path should you choose?\n"

"**SOCRATES:** Excellent! And do you know sigma notation?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** I think so. I could’ve written  that same thing as $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^k$. In general, if you have some function $f: \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, and you want express $f(a)+f(a+1)+…+f(b)$, that is, the sum of $f(k)$ as $k$ ranges from some integer $a$ up to some other integer $b$, you can write it as $\\sum_{k=a}^{b} f(k)$.\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Very good.  So we have $(1+x)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^k$. Now, would you allow me to write this as a sum going all the way out to infinity?\n"
"$(1+x)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{n}{k} x^k$\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Hmm. Ok, I think I see what you’re getting at: Pascal’s Triangle has implied zeros everywhere outside, so $\\binom{n}{k}$ is just zero once $k>n$. So you’ve written it as an infinite sum, even though it secretly terminates after finitely many terms. But what purpose does extending it serve?\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Well, let me ask you this: can you think of any way of making sense of this formula when $n=-1$?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Huh? You can’t use binomial coefficients. How do you choose 3 things from -1 things, that makes no sense!\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Ok, sure, but so many great discoveries in mathematics occur when you realize a way to **break the rules**, and follow some pattern **past** its intended... limit (no pun intended…). Put yourself in Newton’s shoes, if you can; what might a genius like him come up with?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Well, we do have this other formula for binomial coefficients, not in terms of combinatorics, but just as factorials, $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}$. That still doesn’t help because what the heck is $(-1)!$ supposed to be?! Oh, but wait! We can also write this as:\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"And in this way, we “bypass” the issue of dealing with $(-1)!$, and just go straight to “normal” numbers.\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Can you please write this using product notation?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Sure, it's just like summation notation but with a $\\Pi$:\n"
"\n"
" $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{1}{k!}\\prod_{\\ell=1}^{k}(n-\\ell)$.\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Whoops, are you sure about those bounds in the product?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Argh! It's so easy to make a silly mistake.\n"
"After writing down the formula, I should have\n"

"**SIMPLICIO:** Ok, so if we agree to follow this pattern, then we get:\n"

"- $\\binom{-1}{0} = 1$, which makes sense because any row of Pascal's triangle starts with at $1=\\binom{c}{0}$; then\n"
"\n"
"- $\\binom{-1}{1} = (-1)/1! = -1$, which also makes sense because the next term in the \"$c$th row\" of Pascal's triangle is always\n"

"\n"
"- $\\binom{-1}{2} = (-1)(-2)/2! = +1$,\n"
"\n"
"- $\\binom{-1}{3} = (-1)(-2)(-3)/3!=-1$.\n"
"\n"
"Ok so I see the pattern:\n"
"it just alternates between $+1$ and $-1$, so the series goes:\n"
"\n"
" $(1+x)^{-1} = 1 - x + x^2 - x^3+x^4-x^5+\\cdots$.\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Very good! But does this formula make any actual\n"

"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Ok, if that series is supposed to \"represent\"\n"
"$1/(1+x)$, then if I multiply the whole thing by\n"

"\n"
"- $\\binom{1/2}{0} = 1$ (as always)\n"

"- $\\binom{1/2}{3} = (1/2)(-1/2)(-3/2)/3! = 1/16$\n"
"\n"
"- $\\binom{1/2}{4} = \\frac{(1/2)(-1/2)(-3/2)(-5/2)}{4!} =  -\\frac{5}{128}$\n"

"\\frac{5}{128}x^4+\\cdots$\n"
"\n"
"But wait -- this is supposed to be $\\sqrt{1+x}$?!\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Again, go into Newton's thinking: how might he go about justifying whether this formula makes any sense?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Oh, ok, I think I see! If we square the formula and multiply everything out, I guess we're supposed to get $1+x$ -- that would justify calling the series $\\sqrt{1+x}$.\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Go for it!\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Ok, so I want\n"
"\n"
"$\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{1}{8}x^2 + \\frac{1}{16}x^3 -\n"
"\\frac{5}{128}x^4+\\cdots\\right)^2$\n"
"\n"
"That means squaring every term, and also adding twice every product of distinct pairs of terms.\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Right. Can you think of a good way of keeping track of everything?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Oh, I know! Let's group things by the power of $x$ involved. The first one is easy: $x^0=1$, which you only get from squaring the first term. So that coefficient is $1$.\n"
"\n"
"For the coefficient of $x^1$, I can't square anything involving $x$'s, so I\n"
"can only multiply the $x$ term by the constant term, and of course double it.\n"
"That's just $2 \\times 1 \\times \\frac{1}{2}x = x$. So the coefficient of $x$ is $1$.\n"
"\n"
"For $x^2$, I get two contributions  from constant times quadratic: $2 \\times 1 \\times \\left(-\\frac{1}{8}x^2\\right) = -\\frac{1}{4}x^2$ and also from the square of the linear term: $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}x^2$. So the total coefficient is $-\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = 0$.\n"
"\n"
"Let's try a few more. To get $x^3$, I need:\n"
"- $2 \\times 1 \\times \\frac{1}{16}x^3 = \\frac{1}{8}x^3$ (constant times the $x^3$ term)\n"
"- $2 \\times \\frac{1}{2}x \\times \\left(-\\frac{1}{8}x^2\\right) = -\\frac{1}{8}x^3$ (the $x$ term times the $x^2$ term)\n"

"Now, suppose you wanted to compute something like $\\sqrt 3$ -- can you think of a way of doing it using this formula?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Hmm the function is $\\sqrt {1+x}$, so I guess I want to set $x=2$. Then I get:\n"
"\n"
"$\\sqrt {1+2} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}(2) - \\frac{1}{8}(2)^2 + \\frac{1}{16}(2)^3 -\n"
"\\frac{5}{128}(2)^4 + \\cdots$\n"
"\n"
"Adding up these five terms comes out to $11/8 = 1.375$, not so close to $\\sqrt3\\approx1.73$. And the individual terms\n"
"are not so small, for instance, the last one, $\\frac{5}{128}(2)^4 = 5/8 = 0.625$.\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Well, sure, if you set $x$ to be large, like $x > 1$, then the powers of $x$ are also larger and larger (and exponentially so!)... Can you think of something else you could do?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:**\n"
"Ah, I think I see! I know that\n"
"$3$ is near $4$, which is a perfect square. So what if we write\n"
"\n"
"$\\sqrt 3 = \\sqrt{4-1} = \\sqrt{4(1-\\frac14)}=2\\sqrt{1-\\frac14}$\n"
"\n"
"So now if I apply our formula with $x=-1/4$ (which is less than one!), I guess I'll get:\n"
"\n"
"$\\sqrt3 \\approx 2\\left(\n"
"1 + \\frac{1}{2}(-1/4) - \\frac{1}{8}(-1/4)^2 + \\frac{1}{16}(-1/4)^3 -\n"

"\n"

"We got 3 decimal places of accuracy, nice!\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Great! Now you see the power of Newton's Binomial Theorem. Ok, so then let's return all the way back to your original question, about Newton's estimate for $\\pi$.\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Hmmm, $\\pi$ is the ratio of circumference to diameter in a circle. So where am I supposed to find a length.\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Ah, but what did we learn from Archimedes?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Oh, that $\\pi$ is also an *area*, not just a length. It's the area of a unit circle $\\pi r^2$ where $r=1$.\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Beautiful. And could you find a circle's area lurking somewhere?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:**  I think I see it! Thanks to Descartes, and \"Cartesian\" coordinates, we can express the  circle as the graph of $x^2+y^2=1$, or to make it a function, $y=\\sqrt{1-x^2}$. So we just have to replace $x$ in our series with $-x^2$.\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Luckily, Newton had just invented calculus! So how else\n"
"could he compute the area under this curve?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** With an integral! So:\n"

"$\\frac{\\pi}4 = \\int_0^1 \\sqrt{1-x^2} \\, dx =\n"
"\\int_0^1 \\left(1 - \\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{x^4}{8} - \\frac{x^6}{16} - \\frac{5x^8}{128} - \\cdots\\right) dx$\n"
"\n"
"I'll just integrate term by term,...\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Whoa, hang on! Why are you allowed... You know what, nevermind, sorry.\n"
"Just go ahead.\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Ok, weirdo. Anyway. So integrating term by term, I get:\n"
"\n"
"$\\frac{\\pi}4 = \\left[x - \\frac{x^3}{6} - \\frac{x^5}{40} - \\frac{x^7}{112} - \\frac{5x^9}{1152} - \\cdots\\right]_0^1$\n"
"\n"
"$= 1 - \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{40} - \\frac{1}{112} - \\frac{5}{1152} - \\cdots $\n"
"\n"
"Wow! So Newton got an infinite series for $\\pi$!\n"
"If I evaluate just these five terms, and cross multiply by the factor of $4$, I get the fraction\n"
"$32057/10080\\approx 3.180$, not bad!\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Not bad indeed. You know, Simplicio, many math papers have roughly zero new ideas; they're just\n"
"doing something nobody bothered to do before in a slightly\n"
"newer context. A really good math paper can have one or two genuinely new ideas. Newton is already on new idea number five, and he's still not done!\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Ok, so what's new idea number six?\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Well, remember how you integrated all the way up to $x=1$? In your series,\n"
"\n"
"$\\frac{\\pi}4 = \\left[x - \\frac{x^3}{6} - \\frac{x^5}{40} - \\frac{x^7}{112} - \\frac{5x^9}{1152} - \\cdots\\right]_0^1$\n"
"\n"
"you have all these high powers of $x$ but they're being \"wasted\" because you're setting $x$ to $1$. What if instead  you only integrated up to, say, $x=1/2$?\n"
"\n"
"**SIMPLICIO:** Ooh, cool! Then the series will converge much more rapidly. But wait, that changes the geometry. Instead of a quarter-circle, we now have... a 30 degree sector, which has area $\\pi/12$, plus a 30-60-90 triangle -- ah that must be why you suggested $x=1/2$ -- with area $\\frac12\\times\\frac12\\times\\frac{\\sqrt3}2$.\n"
"\n"
"[![Integrating to x=1/2](images/PiOver12.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_a_circle)\n"
"\n"
"Good thing we already know how to quickly estimate $\\sqrt3$ to high accuracy! (Ah, that's the trade-off: we could set $x$ even smaller, for faster convergence, but then we'll need to deal with ever more complicated geometric evaluations; so $x=1/2$ is a \"sweet spot\".) So now:\n"
"\n"
" $ \\frac{\\pi}{12} +  \\frac{\\sqrt3}8 =\n"
"\\left[x - \\frac{x^3}{6} - \\frac{x^5}{40} - \\frac{x^7}{112} - \\frac{5x^9}{1152} - \\cdots\\right]_0^{1/2}$\n"

"\n"
"Again evaluating just these five terms already gives the fraction $9874097/20643840$.\n"

"## Natural Language Proof of `1 / n → 0`\n"
"\n"
"**Theorem**: The sequence `a(n) = 1 / n` converges to `0`.\n"
"\n"
"**Proof**:\n"
"Let `ε > 0` be given. We need to find `N : ℕ` such that for all `n ≥ N`, we have `|1 / n - 0| < ε`.\n"
"\n"
"Since `ε > 0`, we have `1 / ε > 0`. By the Archimedean Property, there exists a natural number `N` such that `1 / ε < N`. We choose this value of `N`, and use it.\n"
"\n"
"Now let `n ≥ N` be given. We need to show that `|1 / n| < ε`.\n"
"\n"
"Since `1 / ε < N` and `N ≤ n`, we have that `1 / ε < n`. Since both `1 / ε` and `n` are positive, taking reciprocals reverses the inequality: `1 / n < ε`.\n"
"\n"
"Therefore, `|1 / n - 0| = |1 / n| = 1 / n < ε`, which completes the proof. □\n"
"\n"
"## What We Just Accomplished\n"

"This proof demonstrates several key concepts:\n"
"\n"
"1. **The power of the Archimedean Property**: Without it, we couldn't guarantee the existence of a suitable `N`.\n"
"\n"
"2. **The `ε`-`N` definition in action**: We explicitly constructed `N` in terms of `ε`, showing the quantifier structure `∀ε, ∃N, ∀n`.\n"
"\n"
"3. **Rigorous inequality manipulation**: What seems \"obvious\" requires careful attention to positivity and type casting.\n"
"\n"
"4. **The bridge between intuition and formality**: The intuitive idea that \"`1 / n` gets arbitrarily small\" becomes a precise mathematical statement."

"If you want to *really* challenge yourself, play this level \"blind\".

"More broadly, the purpose of learning to solve Real Analysis problems is to learn to *think*, clearly, precisely.

"\n"
"An LLM could easily work through all these Lean levels by pattern matching and logical manipulation - just as you could solve multiplication problems by plugging them into a calculator instead of memorizing your times tables. But that completely defeats the purpose of the exercise, which is to rewire your brain and build mathematical intuition. It's like deciding that you want to bench press 200 pounds, loading up the bar, and then using a forklift to lift it for you while you stand underneath - you might have moved the weight, but you haven't gotten any stronger. The real value isn't in producing correct proofs, it's in the cognitive transformation that happens when you *struggle* through the reasoning yourself, building the mental pathways that let you see mathematical structure intuitively."

"\n"
"## 1. Products of Sequences (The Big Boss!)\n"
"\n"
"We finish the **Algebraic Limit Theorem** by proving that products of convergent sequences converge:\n"
"- If `a n → L` and `b n → M`, then `a n * b n → L * M`\n"
"\n"
"This is the hardest part of the Algebraic Limit Theorem, requiring a clever trick. The geometric intuition comes from thinking about rectangles and the product rule from calculus.\n"
"\n"
"Combined with our earlier work, you'll be able to compute limits of any algebraic expression!\n"
"\n"
"## 2. Order Limit Theorem\n"
"\n"
"Next, we shift from algebra to **inequalities**. Does boundedness pass through limits?\n"
"- If `a n ≤ K` for all `n` and `a n → L`, then `L ≤ K`\n"
"\n"
"This theorem respects the order structure of the real numbers and is fundamental for comparison arguments. We'll prove it by contradiction—a beautiful example of when that technique is the natural choice.\n"
"\n"
"**Warning:** Strict inequalities don't pass through! Even if `a n < K` for all `n`, we only get `L ≤ K`.\n"
"\n"
"## 3. Subsequences\n"
"\n"
"Finally, we introduce **subsequences**—sequences formed by dropping out some terms and sliding everyone to the left.\n"
"\n"
"The key result: **every subsequence of a convergent sequence converges to the same limit**.\n"
"\n"
"The contrapositive gives us a powerful divergence test: if two subsequences converge to different limits, the original sequence diverges!\n"
"\n"
"We'll see this in action with `a n = (-1)^n`, which oscillates but has subsequences converging to 1 (even indices) and -1 (odd indices).\n"

"## Looking Ahead:\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"You've just proven one of the **cornerstone theorems of real analysis**: convergent sequences with nonzero limits are bounded! This is a result you'll use again and again throughout your journey in analysis.\n"
"\n"
"## What You Accomplished\n"
"\n"
"You proved that convergence implies boundedness:\n"
"```\n"
"SeqLim a L → L ≠ 0 → SeqBdd a\n"
"```\n"
"\n"
"This tells us something profound: **convergent sequences can't escape to infinity**. They must remain trapped in a finite region of the real line.\n"
"\n"
"### Key Techniques You Mastered:\n"
"\n"
"1. **Two-region strategy** - You split the natural numbers into two parts:\n"
"   - Eventually (n ≥ N): where convergence gives you control\n"
"   - Initially (n < N): where you used your TermLtSum theorem\n"
"\n"
"2. **Constructing clever bounds** - You built `M = 2*|L| + ∑ k ∈ range N, |a k|`, which elegantly captures both regions in a single expression\n"
"\n"
"3. **Case analysis** - You used `by_cases` to handle the two regions separately, applying the appropriate bound for each\n"
"\n"
"4. **Connecting theorems** - You saw how `TermLtSum` from Level 1 became an essential tool for handling finitely many terms\n"
"\n"
"## Why This Matters\n"
"\n"
"The boundedness of convergent sequences is fundamental throughout mathematics:\n"
"\n"
"- **Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem**: Every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence (you've proven half of this!)\n"
"- **Uniform Convergence**: Bounded sequences are essential for proving uniform convergence results\n"
"- **Compactness**: This result is key to understanding compactness in metric spaces\n"
"- **Practical Analysis**: Knowing a sequence stays bounded helps with error analysis and numerical computations\n"
"\n"
"## The Missing Piece: L = 0\n"
"\n"
"Notice we assumed `L ≠ 0` in this proof. The case where `L = 0` is left as an exercise, but the idea is similar:\n"
"- Use convergence with `ε = 1` to bound terms eventually by `1`\n"
"- Handle the finitely many initial terms with TermLtSum\n"
"- The bound becomes `M = 1 + ∑ k ∈ range N, |a k|`\n"
"\n"
"## Looking Ahead\n"
"\n"
"You now understand that convergent sequences live in a bounded world. This prepares you for deeper results:\n"

"**What We Constructed:**\n"
"\n"
"The subsequence `σ(n) = 2*n` extracts the even-indexed terms:\n"
"- Original sequence: `-1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, ...`\n"
"- Even subsequence: `1, 1, 1, 1, ...` → converges to 1\n"
"\n"
"**The Other Subsequence:**\n"
"\n"
"Similarly, the odd-indexed subsequence `τ(n) = 2*n + 1` gives:\n"
"- Odd subsequence: `-1, -1, -1, -1, ...` → converges to -1\n"
"\n"
"**Why This Proves Divergence:**\n"
"\n"
"We now have **two subsequences converging to different limits** (1 and -1). By the Subsequence Theorem, if the full sequence `(-1)^n` converged to some limit `L`, then *every* subsequence would have to converge to that same `L`.\n"
"\n"
"But we have subsequences converging to 1 and -1, which are different! This is a contradiction, so `(-1)^n` does not converge.\n"
"\n"
"This is a powerful technique: **to prove divergence, exhibit two subsequences with different limits.**\n"
"\n"
"**The `let` Tactic in Action:**\n"
"\n"
"Notice how `let` allowed us to define `σ` cleanly within the proof. The `fun n ↦ 2*n` syntax creates an anonymous function, and `let` gives it a name we can use.\n"
"\n"
"This is much cleaner than trying to construct the function implicitly!\n"
"\n"
"**Subsequences Extract Hidden Structure:**\n"
"\n"
"Even though `(-1)^n` oscillates wildly and has no limit, by looking at subsequences we can isolate the \"constant behavior\" hidden within:\n"
"- The even terms are constantly 1\n"
"- The odd terms are constantly -1\n"

"Subsequences let us zoom in on specific patterns and behaviors that might be obscured in the full sequence.\n"

"What you just proved is that any convergent sequence is eventually bounded below (relative to its limit). This might seem like a small technical detail, but it's actually a building block for many major theorems. For instance, this type of reasoning is crucial in proving that convergent sequences are bounded, and that continuous functions on compact sets achieve their minima.\n"
"\n"
"**The Strategic Breakdown:**\n"
"Notice the elegant flow of your proof: you started with the abstract convergence condition, chose a specific `ε` (namely `1`), extracted the absolute value condition, unpacked it using `abs_lt` to get both bounds, and then focused on just the bound you needed. This is mathematical reasoning at its finest—systematic, precise, and efficient.\n"
"\n"
"**Technical Insight:**\n"

"**Why This Matters:**\n"
"Case analysis is everywhere in mathematics. From proving that every integer is either even or odd, to showing that continuous functions on closed intervals achieve their extrema, the ability to systematically consider all possibilities is crucial for rigorous reasoning.\n"

"**Strategic Insight:**\n"
"In our example, both cases led to the same algebraic manipulation (`ring_nf`), but that won't always be true. Often, different cases require entirely different approaches. Learning to adapt your strategy to each case while keeping sight of the overall goal is a key mathematical skill.\n"

"**Looking Forward:**\n"
"As we continue with convergence proofs and other analysis topics, you'll find `cases'` invaluable for handling statements like \"either the sequence is bounded above or below\" or \"either the limit exists or the sequence diverges.\" The systematic approach you've learned here will serve you well in these more complex scenarios.\n"

"up to a variable amount, $x$, that is, let\n"
" $F(x) := \\int_a^x f(t)dt$, then the derivative of the new function is just $F'(x) = f(x)$.\n"

"polynomials, $f_n(x) = x^n$, on the unit interval $[0,1]$. When you take high powers of any point\n"

"then it has to cross zero at some point in between.\n"
"\n"
"**SOCRATES:** Very good. Tell me about the function $f : x \\mapsto x^2 - 2$. (We say: \"$f$ maps\n"
"$x$ to $x^2-2$\". Note that we write $f : \\R \\to \\R$ to mean that $f$ takes real numbers to real numbers, but\n"

"**SIMPLICIO:** Ok, well if $x$ is a rational number, then so is $x^2$, and hence so is $x^2-2$.\n"

"\n"

"(Of course the condition that `ε` be positive is mathematically superfluous, and is only here for pedagogical purposes.)\n"
"\n"
"If you're thinking that `rfl` will do the trick, that's a good idea, but it won't work, because the goal isn't (yet) an equality. So we need to do something else first.\n"
"\n"
"In Lean, as in mathematics, \"for all\" is written using `∀`; this is called the *universal quantifier*, and is gotten by typing \\forall, that is, backslash, then `forall`, then a space. In Lean, this goal looks like so:\n"
"\n"
"`∀ ε > 0, (ε + 1)^2 = (ε + 1)^2`.\n"
"\n"
"(Note that to write an epsilon in Lean, you just type \\\\e, that is, backslash, then `e`, then space.)\n"
"\n"
"To prove a \"for all\" statement, you need to show that it's true for an arbitrary element. In English, you would say: give me an arbitrary `ε`, and give me the fact that it's positive (we can give that fact a name, like `hε`, since it's a hypothesis about `ε`, or perhaps an even more descriptive name like `ε_pos`, since the hypothesis is the positivity of `ε`). Note that `ε` here is a dummy variable, and we could choose to name it something else on the fly. In English, we might say: give me some `ε`, but I want to call it `Alice`; then give me the fact that `Alice` is positive, and my goal will be to prove that `(Alice + 1)^2 = (Alice + 1)^2`. If we were more polite, we might replace \"give me\" above with \"introduce\", like:\n"
"introduce an `ε`, and introduce the fact, call it `hε`, that `ε` is positive.\n"
"\n"
"In Lean, the syntax for this is the command `intro`, followed by whatever name you want to give a dummy variable or a hypothesis.\n"
"\n"
"So: when you see a goal that starts with `∀`, you can write `intro` to \"introduce\" the variable. For example:\n"
"- `intro ε` introduces the variable ε. But look at the goal state now! It changes to: `ε > 0 → (ε + 1)^2 = (ε + 1)^2`. So we're not done introducing things.\n"
"- Then `intro hε` introduces the hypothesis that `ε > 0` (and again, you can call the hypothesis whatever you want; try `intro ε_pos` instead).\n"

msgid "# Level 1: The Archimedean Property\n"
"\n"
"The so-called Archimedean Property (which I think is originally due to Eudoxus, and appears already in Euclid's Elements Book V) is a fundamental property of the real numbers that captures the intuitive notion that there are no \"infinitely large\" or \"infinitesimally small\" positive real numbers.\n"
"\n"
"More precisely, it states that no matter how small `ε > 0` is, there is always a natural number `N` so that `1 / N` is even smaller than `ε` (and of course positive). Equivalently, we can state it as: for any positive real number `ε`, there exists a natural number `N` such that `1 / ε < N`.\n"
"\n"
"*Why does this matter?* The Archimedean Property is one of the most fundamental properties distinguishing the real numbers from other number systems. Without it, we could have \"infinitely large\" or \"infinitesimally small\" positive numbers, which would break most of calculus and analysis.\n"
"\n"
"Our goal will be to prove the following:\n"
"\n"
"**Theorem (ArchProp)**: For any `ε : ℝ` with `0 < ε`, there exists `N : ℕ` such that `1 / ε < N`.\n"
"\n"
"This is mathematically \"obvious\" to most people—if you have a positive number ε, no matter how small, you can always find a natural number large enough that 1 / ε is smaller than it. (At least it seems obvious, and perhaps becomes less so once you remember that we don't yet know what the real numbers actually *are*... We'll continue postponing the construction for some time.) But how do you actually formalize this in Lean?\n"
"\n"
"## The Natural Language Proof Strategy\n"
"\n"
"First, let's think about this in natural language. The key insight is that we need to provide a specific natural number `N` that works.\n"
"\n"
"A natural choice would be to use something related to the ceiling function. The ceiling function `x ↦ ⌈x⌉` rounds any real number up to the nearest integer. However, there's a subtle issue here: the standard ceiling function takes values in integers `ℤ`, but we need values in `ℕ` (the natural numbers). These are *not* the same thing!!\n"
"\n"
"Fortunately, Lean provides the \"natural number ceiling function\" written `x ↦ ⌈x⌉₊`, which takes any real number and returns a natural number.\n"
"(You can write these symbols using `\\lceil`, `\\rceil`, and `\\_+`. Or if you're lazy like me, just copy and paste them from elsewhere.)\n"
" For negative inputs, this function returns `0`. For example, `⌈-3.14⌉₊ = 0` and `⌈3.14⌉₊ = 4`.\n"
"\n"
"Now our strategy becomes clear:\n"
"- **Choice of N**: Use `N = ⌈1 / ε⌉₊ + 1`\n"
"- **Why this works**: We have the \"key inequality\": `1 / ε ≤ ⌈1 / ε⌉₊`, which holds by the definition of the ceiling function\n"
"- **Getting strict inequality**: Adding 1 gives us `1 / ε < ⌈1 / ε⌉₊ + 1`\n"
"\n"
"## The Lean Implementation Challenges\n"
"\n"
"In Lean, the first two steps of our natural language proof work fine, but then we encounter the issue of **type coercion** (\"casting\" between different number types). We'll discuss this in more detail later, but again it has to do with the fact that `ℕ`, `ℤ`, `ℚ`, and `ℝ` are all different kinds of things, and we need to be able to move numbers up the \"sophistication\" heirarchy, with natural numbers being the simplest objects and the reals being the most complicated (so much so that we keep postponing their construction).\n"
"\n"
"For example, notice that when we'll write our `have` statement to establish the key inequality:\n"
"\n"
"`have fact : 1 / ε ≤ ⌈1 / ε⌉₊ := by WhateverTheProofIs`\n"
"\n"
"Lean will record it as:\n"
"\n"
"`fact : 1 / ε ≤ ↑⌈1 / ε⌉₊`\n"
"\n"
"Notice the mysterious up arrow `↑`. This represents a coercion function from natural numbers to real numbers:\n"
"\n"
"↑ : ℕ → ℝ\n"
"\n"
"This is because `ℕ`, `ℤ`, `ℚ`, and `ℝ` are all **different** types in Lean's type system (and really, in mathematics, as we'll see when we construct the real numbers)! Even though we think of natural numbers as being \"contained\" in the real numbers, formally they are distinct types of things, and Lean needs explicit coercion functions to convert between them.\n"
"\n"
"*Think of it this way*: the natural number `3 : ℕ` and the fraction `3 / 1 : ℚ` and the real number `3.000 : ℝ` are different objects that just happen to represent the same mathematical value.\n"
"\n"
"The `push_cast` tactic helps manage these coercions, kind of like `ring_nf` but for casting instead of ring operations.\n"
"\n"
"## New Tools You'll Need\n"
"\n"
"- `⌈ ⬝ ⌉₊`: The natural number ceiling function\n"
"- `push_cast`: Tactic that handles coercions between number types\n"
"- `bound`: Solves many routine inequalities\n"
"\n"
"The `bound` tactic can solve many \"trivial\" inequalities once the types are properly aligned.\n"

"\n"
"**Theorem (in natural language):** If a sequence has the same value for every term, then it converges to that constant value.\n"
"\n"
"**Proof:** Suppose we have a sequence $a(n)$ where $a(n) = L$ for all $n$, and we want to show that this sequence converges to $L$.\n"
"\n"
"By definition, we need to show that for any tolerance $\\varepsilon > 0$, we can find a point $N$ such that for all $n \\geq N$, we have $|a(n) - L| < \\varepsilon$.\n"
"\n"
"This is almost trivially simple: since $a(n) = L$ for every $n$, we have:\n"
"$$|a(n) - L| = |L - L| = |0| = 0$$\n"
"\n"
"Since $0 < \\varepsilon$ for any positive $\\varepsilon$, we can choose any $N$ we want (we chose $N = 1$ in the proof, but $N = 0$ or $N = 1000$ would work equally well).\n"

"\n"
"We've seen that convergent sequences are bounded. Now we'll prove that **Cauchy sequences are also bounded**—without ever mentioning a limit!\n"
"\n"
"This is a beautiful result because it shows that the Cauchy property alone (terms getting close to *each other*) is strong enough to guarantee boundedness, even though we don't know if the sequence converges or *where* it might converge to.\n"

"\n"
"Prove: `a` is bounded (i.e., `∃ M, ∀ n, |a n| ≤ M`)\n"
"\n"
"## The Key Insight\n"
"\n"
"If a sequence is Cauchy, then eventually all terms are clustered together. Specifically, if we use `ε = 1` in the Cauchy definition, then for all `m ≥ N`, we have:\n"
"\n"
"$|a_m - a_N| < 1$\n"
"\n"
"This means all terms after `N` stay within distance 1 of $a_N$, so they're all bounded by $|a_N| + 1$.\n"
"\n"
"But what about the finitely many terms *before* `N`? We just take their maximum (or what's technically easier: their sum)!\n"
"\n"
"## Strategy\n"
"\n"
"1. **Apply Cauchy with `ε = 1`**: Get an `N` such that all terms after `N` are within distance 1 of $a_N$\n"
"2. **Bound the tail**: Show that for `m ≥ N`, we have $|a_m| ≤ |a_N| + 1$ using the triangle inequality\n"
"3. **Bound the initial segment**: The terms $a_0, a_1, ..., a_{N-1}$ are finitely many, so their sum of absolute values bounds each one\n"
"4. **Combine**: Take $M = |a_N| + 1 + \\sum_{k < N} |a_k|$ as your overall bound\n"
"5. **Case split**: Use `by_cases` to handle `m < N` versus `m ≥ N` separately\n"

"\n"
"## The Goal\n"
"\n"
